# WildfireSim
Senior Project that simulates the possibilities of a wild fire spreading

# Background Info:
- 3 factors that primarily affect a wildfire
  - Topography
  - Weather 
  - Fuel
  - (https://www.nps.gov/articles/wildland-fire-behavior.htm)


# TODO: Get data from 3 primary factors

- investigate different types of maps to use in generating simulations
  - most likely topographical map **
  - is this data we can get remotely, or something the simulator will take in through command line

- weather should be pretty easy to get programmatically
- possible weather data to get:
  - current weather in location
  - weather given a specific date
  - given a time of year, find trends in what weather could be in order to  predict the weather for the simulation?

- How do we determine the available fuel for a wild fire given a location? Investigate this / these
  - National Forest type dataset
  - Forest type maps
  - satallite maps
  - Find other options. The above ones aren't great upon initial look
